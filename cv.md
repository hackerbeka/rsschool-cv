## Summary
*What is my goal?* 
My goal is **self-realization**, to become the best of the best in my specialty and to do for our world what will help improve it. I cannot sit in one place, I need to move forward, learn something new every day, which will take me to a new level.

I am by nature a purposeful person who is not afraid of obstacles and achieves his goal. I believe that the most important thing in a person is his desire to learn every day and love his job that he does. After all, the essence of our whole life is learning. Life is one big school - *"School of Life"*.

I started my training in *front-end development* in February, 2020. At first, I was fond of creating a general look and displaying content using *HTML*, then I connected *CSS*. Studied on *YouTube* videos and read various documentation related to web development. I completed a basic course on site layout in [Skillbox](https://go.skillbox.ru/), which includes *HTML / CSS and JavaScript*. Studied different tags on the [WedReference](https://webref.ru/) website. And also there is knowledge in *Javascript*.
Also I understand Photoshop through *Adobe Photoshop* and *Figma*. Of course, then knowledge in this area was at a basic level, but now having entered the ***Rolling Scopes School***, I got a lot of motivation to learn and develop in front-end development. 

I learned about the course from the Instagram of ***Epam Kazakhstan*** and immediately registered there. I knew that, this was my chance and I shouldn't miss it.Since having plunged into the world of the front-end and communicating with students from RS School, I see how they develop themselves, help each other and this is just a brain explosion, there is so much motivation and knowledge that I want to learn and develop.
