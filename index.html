            What is my goal? My goal is self-realization, to become the best of the 
            best in my specialty and to do for our world what will help improve it. 
            I cannot sit in one place, I need to move forward, learn something new 
            every day, which will take me to a new level.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am by nature a purposeful person who is not afraid of obstacles and 
            achieves his goal. I believe that the most important thing in a person 
            is his desire to learn every day and love his job that he does. After 
            all, the essence of our whole life is learning. Life is one big 
            school - "School of Life".
          </p>

            I started my training in front-end development in February, 2020. At first, 
            I was fond of creating a general look and displaying content using HTML, then 
            I connected CSS. Studied on YouTube videos and read various documentation 
            related to web development. I completed a basic course on site layout in 
            <a href="https://go.skillbox.ru/" target="_blank">Skillbox</a>, which includes HTML / CSS and JavaScript. Studied different tags 
            on the <a href="https://webref.ru/" target="_blank">WedReference</a> website. And also there is knowledge in Javascript. Also 
            I understand Photoshop through Adobe Photoshop and Figma. Of course, then 
            knowledge in this area was at a basic level, but now having entered the Rolling 
            Scopes School, I got a lot of motivation to learn and develop in front-end development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned about the course from the Instagram of Epam Kazakhstan and immediately 
            registered there. I knew that, this was my chance and I shouldn't miss it.Since 
            having plunged into the world of the front-end and communicating with students 
            from RS School, I see how they develop themselves, help each other and this is 
            just a brain explosion, there is so much motivation and knowledge that I want to learn and develop.
